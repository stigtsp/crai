#| An archive listing implements the archives method,
#| which returns a sequence of archive URLs.
#| An archive is a tarball or zipball
#| containing a Raku distribution.
#|
#| The URLs returned by an archive listing
#| are used for populating the database.
#|
#| An archive listing is expected not to download the archives.
#| Instead, it should merely return the URLs to the archives.
